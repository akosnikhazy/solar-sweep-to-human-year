# solar-sweep-to-human-year
My old small script that calculates solar sweeps. I upload this to keep it around, as the domain where I kept this so far will die off at some point, yet this thing still visited and used today (to my biggest surprise).

# what is this?
There were a thing on the internet called Homestuck. Well it is still a thing, but now its a finished thing. It had an alien spices with their own time calculation. The community needed a tool that can calculate solar sweep to year conversion. So I made this thing in 2011. For this upload I got rid of the facebook meta tags, also put whole jquery min in it. 

# functionality 1
You type a number in one field and it calculates the conversion in the other.

# functionality 2
If you press the random spoiler link it will show a panel from Homestuck.
